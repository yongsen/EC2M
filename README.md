Multipath TCP (<a href="http://mptcp.info.ucl.ac.be/" target="_blank">UCL Homepage</a> or <a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mptcp/charter/" target="_blank">IETF Homepage</a>) enables concurrent wireless links for mobile terminals, but it needs modifications to leverage path diversity and improve energy efficiency. It requires cross-layer design to overcome the mismatch between transport layer and wireless links, and to allocate congestion windows for WiFi and 3G subflows. Some detailed information will be updated lately.
